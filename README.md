This activity visualizes United States Geological Survey earthquake data.

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
-
- Data on significant earthquakes from the past 30 days was collected from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
- The data was visualized creating a map that plots all the earthquakes based on longitude and latitude
  - Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size and depth of the earthquake by color
  - Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when marker is clicked
  - Legend created to provide context for map data

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data
-
- A second dataset (https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) was plotted on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity 
- Each dataset is displayed in separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently
- Layer controls were added to the map
